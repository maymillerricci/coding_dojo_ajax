Basic 1 Post-Its:
Use Ajax to post post-it notes to a site without the page reloading.

Basic 2 Weather:
Use the World Weather Online API and Ajax to get the current weather for cities.

Basic 3 Maps:
Use the Google Maps API and Ajax to get directions from one place to another.

Intermediate Table:
Use Ajax to auto-filter results in a table as you type letters of a person's name or the date before or after which they registered.  Then redo the table to also add pagination using Ajax.

Advanced Post-Its:
Redo the post-its such that you can edit and delete notes using Ajax.  When you click on a note it should allow you to edit its contents.
